      'It depends on what you want to see. The Great Migration river crossings in the Maasai Mara peak from July to October, while the calving season runs January to March. Wildlife viewing is excellent year round, and our planners will match your dates to the best parks and experiences.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Are your safaris private or group tours?',
    answer:
      'Both. Most of our guests travel on private safaris with their own vehicle and driver-guide, but we also arrange small group departures and tailor-made itineraries for families, couples, and larger parties.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What does a Nature Romp safari include?',
    answer:
      'Typically park fees, accommodation, a private 4x4 with a professional driver-guide, transfers, and game drives as set out in your itinerary. We send a clear day-by-day plan and a transparent price before you book, with no hidden costs.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you arrange gorilla trekking permits for Uganda and Rwanda?',
    answer:
      'Yes. We handle gorilla and chimpanzee permits, forest logistics, and lodge access, and we can combine primate trekking with savannah parks or a beach extension.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I pay, and is my booking protected?',
    answer:
      'You secure your safari with a deposit and settle the balance before travel under clear payment terms. As a KATO bonded and licensed tour operator, your booking is protected to recognised industry standards.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you combine a safari with a beach holiday?',
    answer:
      'Absolutely. Safari and beach combinations to Diani, Mombasa, or Zanzibar are some of our most popular itineraries, and we coordinate every flight and transfer in between.'
