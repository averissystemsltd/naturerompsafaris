    'Family safaris balance game drives with shorter travel days, child-friendly lodges, and guides who know how to keep young travellers engaged without rushing the wildlife moments.',
  Honeymoon:
    'Honeymoon routes favour private vehicles, scenic sundowners, and intimate camps where you can slow the pace and celebrate together after long days on the plains.',
  Migration:
    'Migration safaris follow the herds across the Mara-Serengeti ecosystem, with timing built around river crossings, predator activity, and the season you want to witness.',
  Private:
    'Private safaris give you your own vehicle, flexible daily plans, and itineraries shaped around your interests rather than a fixed group schedule.',
  Group:
    'Group departures suit travellers who want a shared adventure with set dates, clear pricing, and the energy of exploring Kenya and Tanzania with like-minded guests.',
  Photography:
    'Photography-focused trips allow extra time at sightings, positioning for light, and guides who understand when to wait for the shot and when to move on.',
  Luxury:
    'Luxury experiences pair premium lodges with seamless logistics, from charter connections to private guiding and handpicked stays in the best wildlife locations.',
  Adventure:
    'Adventure safaris combine classic game viewing with active days, whether that means walking safaris, longer drives, or routes through varied landscapes and remote camps.'
