      $overview$<p>The 6 Days Tsavo East and Kenya Beach Safari begins in Nairobi and combines two of Kenya’s most appealing travel experiences: wildlife viewing and coastal relaxation. The journey first travels to Tsavo East National Park, where guests enjoy an afternoon game drive followed by a full day of wildlife exploration.</p><p>Tsavo East is especially known for its red elephants, open landscapes and landmarks such as Mudanda Rock. After two nights in the park, the route continues to Voi SGR Station for a train journey to Mombasa. From there, guests are transferred to a selected coastal hotel in either Diani or Watamu.</p><p>The beach section provides time to rest after the safari, with opportunities for swimming, hotel relaxation, beach games and evening sundowner experiences. Meals and accommodation are arranged according to the selected package, while the final flight to Nairobi provides a convenient conclusion to the journey.</p><p>Nature Romp Safaris recommends this itinerary for couples, families, small groups and first-time visitors seeking a balanced Kenya bush and beach holiday. It is especially suitable for travelers who want meaningful wildlife experiences without sacrificing time for relaxation along the Indian Ocean coast.</p><h2>Experiences Associated With This Trip</h2><ul><li><p>Tsavo East game drives</p></li><li><p>Red elephant sightings</p></li><li><p>Mudanda Rock visit</p></li><li><p>Wildlife viewing</p></li><li><p>Scenic road travel</p></li><li><p>SGR train experience</p></li><li><p>Diani or Watamu beach stay</p></li><li><p>Swimming and beach games</p></li><li><p>Coastal sundowner experience</p></li><li><p>Flight back to Nairobi</p></li></ul><h2>This Is Suitable For</h2><ul><li><p>Couples seeking a bush and beach holiday</p></li><li><p>Families traveling with children</p></li><li><p>Small private groups</p></li><li><p>First-time visitors to Kenya</p></li><li><p>Wildlife lovers interested in Tsavo East</p></li><li><p>Travelers seeking safari and beach relaxation in one itinerary</p></li></ul>$overview$
