    '<p>This classic 8-day route climbs Mt Kenya through the Burguret forest, crosses the high moorlands, and descends the spectacular Chogoria side. It is a full traverse with time built in for altitude adjustment before summit night.</p><h3>Acclimatization</h3><p>Day 1 overnight in Nanyuki at the foot of the mountain helps your body adjust before trekking begins. The itinerary then ascends steadily through forest, bamboo, and alpine zones with a dedicated night at Top Camp (4,790m) before the Lenana summit attempt.</p><h3>What to carry</h3><p>Hiking gear is not included in the price. Bring sturdy broken-in boots, warm layers, waterproof jacket and trousers, hat, gloves, head torch, sun protection, personal medications, and a good sleeping bag rated for high-altitude nights. Trekking poles are recommended on steep sections.</p>',
