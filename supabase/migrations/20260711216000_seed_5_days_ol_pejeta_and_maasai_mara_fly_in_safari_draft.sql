The journey begins with a scheduled flight from Nairobi to Nanyuki, followed by a game-viewing transfer into Ol Pejeta Conservancy.</p><p>Guests spend two nights in Ol Pejeta, where the itinerary includes morning and afternoon game drives, opportunities to see black and white rhinos, and a visit to the chimpanzee sanctuary. The conservancy also supports elephants, lions, giraffes, zebras and buffaloes.</p><p>The safari then continues by scheduled flight to the Maasai Mara for two nights. An afternoon game drive introduces guests to the reserve, while the following day provides a full safari experience with a picnic lunch and opportunities to search for the Big Five, cheetahs and plains wildlife. An optional Maasai village visit may also be arranged.</p><p>Nature Romp Safaris recommends this package for couples, photographers, conservation enthusiasts and travelers who want to experience two distinct wildlife areas within a compact itinerary.
