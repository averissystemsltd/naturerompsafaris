Located near the park’s Murera Gate area, the camp gives guests convenient access to Meru’s wild landscapes, river systems, open plains, and diverse wildlife.</p><p>For guests booking with Nature Romp Safaris, Ikweta Safari Camp works well for mid-range Meru safari packages, private Kenya safaris, family trips, birdwatching tours, and off-the-beaten-path safari itineraries. It is especially suitable for travelers who want a quieter alternative to Kenya’s busier parks while still enjoying elephants, lions, buffaloes, giraffes, zebras, antelopes, and rich birdlife.</p><p>The camp offers a warm tented safari atmosphere with comfortable en-suite tents, outdoor seating areas, dining spaces, and a swimming pool where guests can relax after game drives. With Nature Romp Safaris, Ikweta Safari Camp can be included in Meru safari itineraries or combined with Samburu, Ol Pejeta, Aberdare, or Mount Kenya for a rewarding central and northern Kenya safari circuit.</p>$description$
