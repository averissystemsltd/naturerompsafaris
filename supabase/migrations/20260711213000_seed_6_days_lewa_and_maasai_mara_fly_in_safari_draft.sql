      $overview$<p>The 6 Days Lewa and Maasai Mara Fly-In Safari combines two of Kenya’s most rewarding wildlife destinations in one efficient itinerary. The journey begins with a scheduled flight from Nairobi to Lewa Conservancy, where guests spend two nights exploring a private conservation area known for black rhinos, Grevy’s zebras and a strong record of wildlife protection.</p><p>Game drives in Lewa offer opportunities to see elephants, lions, leopards and other species across varied landscapes. The itinerary also includes the option of a guided nature walk and time to enjoy the lodge surroundings.</p><p>From Lewa, guests fly directly to the Maasai Mara for three nights of game viewing. Morning and afternoon drives provide opportunities to search for the Big Five and follow the reserve’s abundant plains wildlife. An optional Maasai village visit may also be arranged.</p><p>Nature Romp Safaris recommends this itinerary for couples, honeymooners, photographers and travelers seeking a refined fly-in experience.
