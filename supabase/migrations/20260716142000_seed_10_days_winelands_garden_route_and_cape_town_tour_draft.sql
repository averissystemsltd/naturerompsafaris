Wine tasting participants must meet South Africa's legal drinking-age requirements. Wildlife sightings during the safari drives are natural and cannot be guaranteed. The source mentions crawling and narrow passages at Cango Caves, but the exact cave route should be confirmed before booking. Elephant activities should follow the operating facility's welfare and safety guidelines. Robben Island ferries may be affected by sea and weather conditions. Table Mountain cableway operations depend on wind, visibility and maintenance schedules. Optional Waterfront, Seal Island and additional Winelands activities cost extra.
