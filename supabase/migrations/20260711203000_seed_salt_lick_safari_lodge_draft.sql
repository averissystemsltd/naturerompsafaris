      $description$<p>Salt Lick Safari Lodge is one of Kenya’s most memorable safari stays, known for its elevated design and wildlife-viewing experience. The lodge is set within the Taita Hills wildlife area, where guests can enjoy views of animals gathering around the nearby waterhole and surrounding plains.</p><p>For guests booking with Nature Romp Safaris, Salt Lick Safari Lodge works well for mid-range Tsavo East safari packages, Tsavo West combinations, family safaris, photography trips, and short safaris from Mombasa, Diani, or Nairobi. It is especially suitable for travelers who want a lodge that feels different from the usual safari accommodation, with wildlife often visible from the property itself.</p><p>The lodge offers comfortable rooms raised above the ground, dining facilities, viewing areas, and a relaxed safari atmosphere that makes it ideal for guests looking for both value and experience. With Nature Romp Safaris, Salt Lick Safari Lodge can be included in 2-day, 3-day, or longer Tsavo safari itineraries connecting Tsavo East, Tsavo West, Amboseli, or the Kenya coast.</p>$description$
